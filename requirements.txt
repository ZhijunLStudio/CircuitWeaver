# --- Optional GPU Support ---
# To enable GPU acceleration for embeddings, you need to install the correct
# version of PyTorch that matches your system's CUDA version.
# DO NOT uncomment the line below directly. Instead, go to https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/
# and find the correct command for your specific CUDA version.

# Example for CUDA 12.1 (replace with the command from the PyTorch website):
# torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121

# If you have a GPU and have installed the correct PyTorch version,
# also install the GPU version of FAISS for faster searching.
# The faiss-gpu package can be complex to install. Start with faiss-cpu
# and only upgrade if performance is critical.
