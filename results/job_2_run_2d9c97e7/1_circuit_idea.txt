**Circuit Description:**
This is a concept for a simple analog audio VU (Volume Unit) meter. The circuit takes an audio input signal and processes it to drive a bar graph display, providing a visual representation of the audio level. It uses a precision active rectifier built with an operational amplifier (Op-Amp) to convert the AC audio signal into a DC voltage. This DC voltage is then fed into a dedicated bar graph driver IC (represented as a block), which in turn controls an LED bar graph display.

The hierarchy is used to group the analog signal conditioning components into a single "Active Rectifier" block.

**`schemdraw` Components/Blocks (Total: 7):**

*   `flow.Box`: A parent container labeled "Active Rectifier & Filter". This block will contain the analog front-end.
    *   `opamp.Opamp`: The core of the active rectifier.
    *   `elm.Diode`: To perform the signal rectification.
    *   `elm.Resistor`: As part of the Op-Amp's feedback network.
    *   `elm.Capacitor`: To smooth the rectified DC voltage, creating a peak-following envelope.
*   `dsp.Box`: A block representing the "LM3914 Dot/Bar Display Driver" IC. This IC simplifies driving the LED display.
*   `led.LedBar`: To represent the 10-segment LED bar graph output display.
