**Chosen Type:** Hybrid Diagram

**Circuit Concept Description:**
This circuit is a simple switched-capacitor low-pass filter, a fundamental building block in mixed-signal and data acquisition systems. Instead of a traditional resistor, it uses a capacitor (`C1`) rapidly switched between two states by a pair of MOSFETs (`S1`, `S2`) to simulate a resistor. The effective resistance is determined by the switching frequency and the capacitance of `C1`. This "resistor" forms an RC low-pass filter with the integrating capacitor `C2` and an Opamp.

The primary advantage of this topology, especially in integrated circuits, is that the filter's cutoff frequency depends on a precise clock frequency and the ratio of two capacitors, both of which are much easier to control accurately on a silicon die than the absolute value of a resistor. The Microcontroller (MCU) block is shown as the source of the required non-overlapping clock signals (Φ1 and Φ2).

**`schemdraw` Components List (Total: 8):**

*   `sources.SourceV`: Represents the analog input signal from a sensor.
*   `flow.Box`: A block to hierarchically contain the filter components, labeled "Switched-Capacitor Integrator".
*   `fet.NMOS` (x2): The two switches (`S1`, `S2`) that drive the switched capacitor.
*   `C` (x2): The switched capacitor (`C1`) and the integrating capacitor (`C2`).
*   `opamp.Opamp`: The core of the active integrator.
*   `micro.MCU`: A block representing the microcontroller, which provides the clock signals and would typically house the ADC to read the filtered output.
