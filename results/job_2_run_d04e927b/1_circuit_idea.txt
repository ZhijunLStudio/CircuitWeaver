**Circuit Concept: Automatic Night Light Comparator**

This circuit demonstrates a classic real-world application using a mix of a functional block and discrete components. The system is an automatic night light that turns on an LED when the ambient light level drops below a user-defined threshold.

The core of the design uses a "Light Sensor Frontend" block which contains a Light-Dependent Resistor (LDR) in a voltage divider configuration. The output voltage from this block, which varies with light intensity, is fed into the non-inverting input of an Operational Amplifier (Op-Amp). The Op-Amp is configured as a comparator. A potentiometer provides an adjustable reference voltage to the inverting input, allowing a user to set the light level "trip point". When it gets dark, the sensor voltage drops below the reference voltage, causing the comparator's output to go high and illuminate the LED.
